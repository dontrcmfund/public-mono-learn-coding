# What is TypeScript? (first principles)

Goal: understand what TypeScript is, why it exists, and why it helps beginners and teams.

Why do we care?
- TypeScript helps catch mistakes before running code
- It makes code easier to understand later
- It helps teams share expectations about data shapes

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if JavaScript errors confused you, types give earlier feedback
- Present: you can see likely mistakes directly in the editor
- Future: many production codebases use TypeScript by default

First principles
- TypeScript is JavaScript plus type information
- A type is a label for what kind of value something is
- TypeScript checks code before runtime

Short history (why this exists)
- JavaScript became widely used for large apps
- Large apps needed better tooling and safer refactoring
- TypeScript was introduced in 2012 to add static checking while keeping JavaScript compatibility

Etymology
- `type` means category of value (string, number, object, etc.)
- `script` refers to executable instruction text
- `TypeScript` means script code with explicit type categories

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open a TypeScript lesson file in VS Code
- Read each lesson block
- Observe how type annotations explain intent

If all you remember is one thing
- TypeScript helps you find mistakes earlier and explain intent clearly

Checkpoint
- If you can explain "TypeScript is checked before runtime," you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Which JavaScript mistake would you want to catch before running code?
- How could types help future-you understand old code faster?
