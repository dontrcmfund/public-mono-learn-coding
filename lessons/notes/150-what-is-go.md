# What is Go? (first principles)

Goal: understand what Go is and why teams use it for reliable systems.

Why do we care?
- Go is simple, fast, and good for backend and infrastructure tools
- It has strong built-in support for concurrency
- It encourages readable code and predictable project patterns

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if dynamic-language runtime bugs were hard to trace, Go's typing helps
- Present: you can build small binaries and APIs with low setup friction
- Future: Go is common in cloud, DevOps, and distributed systems work

First principles
- Go is a compiled, statically typed language
- Programs compile to standalone binaries
- The standard library is rich and practical

Short history
- Go was created at Google and open-sourced in 2009
- It was designed to reduce complexity in large codebases
- Its design favors clarity, tooling consistency, and operational simplicity

Etymology
- The language name is simply `Go`
- The command-line tool is commonly invoked as `go`

If all you remember is one thing
- Go is designed for clear code and dependable systems at scale
