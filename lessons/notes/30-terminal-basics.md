# Terminal basics (macOS)

Goal: understand what the terminal is and why it exists.

Why do we care?
- The terminal lets you talk to the computer directly
- It is faster for some tasks once you learn it
- It is the same tool used by many developers everywhere

First principles
- The terminal is a text interface to your computer
- You type commands; the computer responds with text
- It is not magic — it is just another way to control your system

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the Terminal app
- Notice the blinking cursor (that is where you type)
- Do not run anything yet — just notice it is waiting

Checkpoint
- If you can say “the terminal is a text way to control my computer,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might text be faster than clicking sometimes?
- What feels confusing about the terminal right now?
