# What is Python? (first principles)

Goal: understand what Python is, why it is popular, and why it is a good next language.

Why do we care?
- Python is readable and beginner-friendly
- It is widely used in automation, data, web, and AI
- It helps you move from syntax learning to practical scripting quickly

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if syntax noise felt heavy, Python's style is easier to scan
- Present: you can build useful scripts with small code files
- Future: Python is used in many careers and toolchains

First principles
- Python is an interpreted programming language
- It emphasizes readability and clear structure
- Programs are still instructions, values, and control flow

Short history (why this exists)
- Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
- It was designed to be readable and productive for humans
- The community favored "one clear way" design decisions to reduce confusion

Etymology
- The name "Python" comes from "Monty Python," not the snake
- The language culture inherited a friendly, playful style from that origin

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the first Python lesson file
- Read each lesson block and run line by line

If all you remember is one thing
- Python is designed so humans can read and write code more clearly

Checkpoint
- If you can explain why readability is a language feature, you are ready to move on
