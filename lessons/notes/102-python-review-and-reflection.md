# Python review and reflection loop

Goal: retain skills after finishing the capstone sequence.

Why do we care?
- Completion does not guarantee retention
- Reflection turns short-term effort into long-term capability

Review schedule
- Day 1: rerun one basics file and one project file
- Day 3: rerun one API file and one testing file
- Day 7: rerun capstone pipeline and tests
- Day 14: rebuild one project from memory

Reflection prompts
- What input validations did you forget first?
- Which helper functions were easiest to reuse?
- Which failures were hardest to diagnose and why?

Skill check ritual
- Predict output before running
- Run and compare
- Explain mismatch in one sentence

If all you remember is one thing
- Retention is built by spaced reruns and short written reflection
