# What is a compiler? (first principles)

Goal: understand why some code needs translation.

Why do we care?
- Computers only understand certain low-level instructions
- Some languages (like TypeScript) need to be translated
- The compiler does that translation

First principles
- A compiler turns one kind of code into another
- It reads your code and outputs code the computer can run
- Errors often mean “I could not translate this”

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open `docs/tooling.md`
- Notice “TypeScript compiler” is listed
- That means we will add it when we need translation

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a compiler translates code,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might it be helpful to write in a language made for humans?
- How does translation make that possible?
