# Terminal basics (macOS)

Goal: understand what the terminal is, why it exists, and why developers still use it.

Why do we care?
- The terminal gives direct control over your computer
- Many developer tools are command-first
- It is faster and more reproducible for repeated tasks

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if GUI clicking felt slow or confusing, commands simplify repetition
- Present: you can run lesson files and tools with clarity
- Future: terminal fluency is expected in professional software workflows

First principles
- The terminal is a text interface to the operating system
- You send commands; the system returns output
- Commands are explicit instructions, which makes actions repeatable

Short history (why this exists)
- Early computers were controlled entirely through text terminals
- GUIs came later, but command interfaces remained for precision and automation
- Modern development kept terminal workflows because they are scriptable and portable

Etymology
- `terminal` originally meant a physical endpoint connected to a larger computer
- `shell` means the command layer around the operating system core

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the Terminal app
- Notice the blinking cursor (where commands go)
- Do not run anything yet; just observe the interaction model

If all you remember is one thing
- The terminal is a precise, repeatable way to control your computer

Checkpoint
- If you can explain why text commands are useful even with a GUI, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Which repeated task in your life could become one command?
- What part of terminal use still feels uncertain?
