# What are data structures and algorithms? (first principles)

Goal: understand why DSA matters and how it improves problem-solving in real code.

Why do we care?
- Data structures organize information
- Algorithms define steps to solve problems
- Better choices make code faster, clearer, and easier to maintain

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if code felt slow or messy, DSA helps explain why
- Present: you can pick the right container and approach for each task
- Future: DSA skills transfer to interviews, backend systems, and data-heavy apps

First principles
- A data structure is a way to store and access data
- An algorithm is a process that transforms input into output
- Performance and readability are design tradeoffs, not accidents

Short history
- Algorithmic thinking predates computers (formal procedures in mathematics)
- Modern computer science formalized runtime analysis and complexity classes
- Practical programming uses DSA to scale from toy examples to real systems

Etymology
- `algorithm` comes from the name Al-Khwarizmi, a pioneer of procedural math
- `structure` refers to arrangement, not content itself

If all you remember is one thing
- DSA is choosing the right organization and the right steps for a problem
