# Software design capstone plan

Goal: build a mini service with clean boundaries and clear responsibilities.

Capstone project
- Subscription management service
- Layers: domain, use-case service, repository adapter, presenter, CLI handler
- Include explicit tests for core workflows

Why this matters
- Shows how architecture decisions support change and confidence
- Mirrors real backend design in a small, digestible form

Required capabilities
- Add subscriber with validation
- Prevent duplicates
- Deactivate subscriber
- Generate text report

If all you remember is one thing
- A capstone is complete when behavior is clear, layered, and tested
