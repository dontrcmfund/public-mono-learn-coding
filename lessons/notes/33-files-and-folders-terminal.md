# Files and folders in the terminal (macOS)

Goal: create, move, and remove files safely.

Why do we care?
- You can organize and clean up faster
- You can build a project structure quickly

First principles
- Files are text or data stored on disk
- Folders group files together
- Terminal commands are precise and fast

Core commands
- `mkdir name` creates a folder
- `touch name.txt` creates an empty file
- `cp a b` copies
- `mv a b` moves or renames
- `rm name` removes (be careful)

What to do (slow and simple)
- Create a test folder: `mkdir sandbox`
- Create a file: `touch sandbox/note.txt`
- List it: `ls sandbox`

Checkpoint
- If you can say “I can create files and folders,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is `rm` something to treat carefully?
- What would be easier in the terminal than in Finder?
