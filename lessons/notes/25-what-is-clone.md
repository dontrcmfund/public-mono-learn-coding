# What is clone? (first principles)

Goal: understand what “clone” means in Git, and what “origin” is.

Why do we care?
- Clone brings a full copy of a repo to your computer
- You can work locally even without the internet
- The copy includes the full history

First principles
- Clone means “make a full copy”
- The copy includes files and Git history
- After cloning, you have a local repo

What is origin?
- A remote is a saved address for a repo online
- `origin` is the default name for that address
- Git uses it for push and pull

What to do (slow and simple)
- Remember we ran a command to clone this repo
- That created the folder `/Users/don-pro/codex`
- That folder is your local copy

Checkpoint
- If you can say “clone makes a local copy” and “origin is the default remote name,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is a full copy better than downloading a ZIP file?
- What would you lose without history?
