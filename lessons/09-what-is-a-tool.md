# What is a tool? (first principles)

Goal: understand what “tools” mean in coding.

Why do we care?
- Tools help us check, format, and run code
- Good tools reduce mistakes
- Tools make teams consistent

First principles
- A tool is a program that helps other programs
- Examples: linters, formatters, compilers
- We will add them only when we need them

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open `docs/tooling.md`
- Read the short list of tools
- Notice it says “when a lesson needs them”

Checkpoint
- If you can say “tools help us work safely,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might adding tools too early feel overwhelming?
- Which tool sounds most useful to you?
