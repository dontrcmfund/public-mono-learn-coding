# What is an issue? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a GitHub issue is.

Why do we care?
- Issues are a simple way to track tasks or bugs
- They keep ideas organized in one place
- They give you a history of decisions

First principles
- An issue is a note with a title and description
- Anyone with access can read it
- Issues can be open or closed

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the “Issues” tab on GitHub
- Notice it is empty (that is okay)
- Imagine writing a simple learning task there

Checkpoint
- If you can say “an issue is a tracked note,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- How could issues help you plan lessons?
- What would you write as your first issue?
