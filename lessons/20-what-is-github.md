# What is GitHub? (first principles)

Goal: understand what GitHub is in plain language.

Why do we care?
- It stores your code online
- It lets you share work and get help
- It keeps a safe copy if your computer breaks

First principles
- Git is the tool that saves history
- GitHub is a website that stores Git projects
- You can view code, history, and changes there

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open your repo on GitHub
- Find the `README.md` on the page
- Notice you can read files without downloading

Checkpoint
- If you can say “GitHub stores my Git repo online,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is an online backup useful?
- How might sharing code help you learn?
