# History and help (macOS)

Goal: learn how to recall commands and get help.

Why do we care?
- You do not need to memorize everything
- Help is built in
- History saves time

First principles
- The terminal keeps a history of commands
- Most commands can explain themselves

Core commands
- `history` shows past commands
- Press the up arrow to reuse a command
- `man command` shows the manual
- `command --help` shows quick help

What to do (slow and simple)
- Run `history` and see past commands
- Run `man ls` and skim the first page
- Press `q` to quit the manual

Checkpoint
- If you can say “I can find help when stuck,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is it okay to look things up?
- What would you search for first?
