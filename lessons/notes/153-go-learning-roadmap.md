# Go learning roadmap

Goal: move from Go syntax to practical service development with confidence.

Phase 1: Go basics
- Complete basics 1-20
- Focus on types, errors, structs, interfaces

Phase 2: Go projects
- Build small CLI and data-processing tools
- Practice package organization and testable functions

Phase 3: Go modules and package boundaries
- Learn module vs package responsibilities
- Practice dependency clarity and naming conventions

Phase 4: Go API development
- Build HTTP handlers and service layers
- Reuse domain/service/repo approach from Python/FastAPI tracks

Phase 5: Go concurrency
- Learn goroutines, channels, worker pools, context cancellation

Phase 6: Go capstone
- Build layered API + background worker + tests

If all you remember is one thing
- Learn Go in this order: clarity, projects, modules, services, concurrency, capstone
