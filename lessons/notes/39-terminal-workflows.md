# Terminal workflows (macOS)

Goal: combine small commands into useful daily workflows.

Why do we care?
- Small actions become faster when chained
- You start to feel confident using the terminal

Workflow 1: create a clean project folder
- `mkdir practice`
- `cd practice`
- `touch notes.txt`

Workflow 2: organize files by type
- `mkdir images text`
- `mv *.png images/`
- `mv *.txt text/`

Workflow 3: check what changed
- `ls -la`
- `pwd`

Checkpoint
- If you can run a 3‑step flow without panic, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Which workflow felt most useful?
- What would you like to automate next?
