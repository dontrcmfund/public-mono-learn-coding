# History and etymology map (quick reference)

Goal: connect core tools to their historical reasons and naming origins.

Why do we care?
- History explains why tools behave the way they do
- Name origins improve recall and reduce confusion

Quick map
- Terminal: text control model from early computing endpoints
- Git/GitHub: distributed history plus remote collaboration hub
- Docker: shipping-container metaphor for standard packaging
- DOM: programmable model of a document tree in the browser
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime beyond the browser

How to use this note
- When a tool feels weird, ask: "what historical problem was it solving?"
- Then ask: "does this behavior make sense for that problem?"

If all you remember is one thing
- Most quirks are historical tradeoffs, not random design mistakes
