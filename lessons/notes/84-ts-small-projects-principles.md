# TypeScript small projects principles

Goal: use small projects to turn concepts into durable skill.

Why do we care?
- Projects create memory better than isolated syntax drills
- Small scope lowers overwhelm and increases completion
- Repeated patterns build confidence for larger apps

How to run each project lesson
- Read the problem statement
- Predict output before running
- Run and compare
- Change one rule and re-test

Project best practices
- Keep one clear input and one clear output
- Use explicit types for data models
- Add small validation guards early
- Prefer readable logic over clever shortcuts

Past, present, future anchor
- Past: connect project to a real frustration you had
- Present: identify one practical use right now
- Future: map it to a feature in a real app

If all you remember is one thing
- Small, typed projects are the fastest path from understanding to confidence
