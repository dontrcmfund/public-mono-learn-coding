# Python capstone setup (teacher guidance)

Goal: combine basics, projects, API scripting, testing, and CLI into one coherent mini-capstone.

Capstone idea
- Build a CLI tool that fetches or reads service data
- Validates records
- Produces summary text + CSV output
- Includes a small test file for core logic

Why this matters
- This mirrors practical engineering workflow
- Students see how isolated lessons connect into real systems

Capstone constraints (for learning)
- Keep under 300 lines
- Use small focused functions
- Include at least 5 tests
- Handle at least 2 error paths

If all you remember is one thing
- Real confidence comes from connecting concepts into one working tool
