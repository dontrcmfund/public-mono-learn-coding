# What is a command? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a command is in simple terms.

Why do we care?
- A command is how we ask the computer to do a task
- It makes work repeatable and predictable
- It saves time and reduces mistakes

First principles
- A command is just text you type
- The terminal is a place to type commands
- The computer runs the command exactly as written

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open your terminal (do not run anything yet)
- Read this example command: `ls`
- Know that `ls` means “list files”

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a command is a written request,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is it useful to have a written request instead of clicking a button?
- How would you feel if every task had to be done manually?
