# Python common gotchas

Goal: avoid beginner mistakes that feel confusing at first.

Why do we care?
- Python is simple, but a few rules can surprise new learners

Common gotchas
- Indentation is syntax, not just style
- `=` assigns values; `==` compares values
- Mutable types (like lists) can change in place
- Division `/` returns float, even for whole numbers

Rule of thumb
- Keep functions small and explicit
- Print intermediate values while learning
- Read error messages top to bottom

If all you remember is one thing
- Most Python bugs come from small assumptions, not complex logic
