# Your first container (gentle intro)

Goal: run a tiny container and see it work.

Why do we care?
- Running a container makes the idea real
- You gain confidence quickly
- It proves Docker is installed correctly

Why this matters to you (real life)
- You will know your setup works before bigger tasks
- You can trust your environment when you follow tutorials

First principles
- `docker run` starts a container
- It can download the image if missing

What to do (slow and simple)
- In the terminal, run: `docker run hello-world`
- Read the message it prints

If all you remember is one thing
- “hello-world” is just a safe test that Docker works

Checkpoint
- If you see a success message, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What surprised you about the output?
- How did Docker know what to run?
