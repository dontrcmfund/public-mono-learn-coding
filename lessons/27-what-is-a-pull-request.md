# What is a pull request? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a pull request is in GitHub, and what a fork is.

Why do we care?
- Pull requests let you propose changes safely
- They create a place for review and discussion
- Forks let you experiment on your own copy

First principles
- A pull request is a request to merge changes
- It usually compares a branch to `main`
- It shows what changed and why

What is a fork?
- A fork is a copy on GitHub, not on your computer
- It belongs to your account
- You can later propose changes back to the original

What to do (slow and simple)
- On GitHub, click the “Pull requests” tab
- Notice it is empty (that is okay)
- Imagine a future change you would propose

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a pull request asks to merge changes” and “a fork is a GitHub copy,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is review helpful before merging?
- How would a pull request help you learn from feedback?
