# Go first principles

Goal: understand the key design choices that shape Go code style.

Why do we care?
- Language defaults influence architecture and maintenance
- Go's constraints are intentional and productivity-focused

First principles
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Explicit error handling over hidden exceptions
- Composition over inheritance
- Small interfaces and clear boundaries

Tooling principles
- `go fmt` keeps formatting consistent
- `go test` encourages test-first quality habits
- `go mod` standardizes dependency management

Rule of thumb
- Prefer straightforward code that teammates can read quickly

If all you remember is one thing
- Go optimizes for maintainability and operational reliability
