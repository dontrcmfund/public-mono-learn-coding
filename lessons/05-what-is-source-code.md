# What is source code? (first principles)

Goal: understand what “source code” means in plain language.

Why do we care?
- Everything we build is just text someone wrote
- Computers follow those written instructions exactly
- Learning to code is learning to write clear instructions

First principles
- Source code is text that tells a computer what to do
- A program is just a set of instructions
- Files that end in `.ts`, `.js`, `.py` are usually source code

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- Notice it is just text
- Read the comment out loud

Checkpoint
- If you can say “source code is instruction text,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might clear writing matter in code?
- If code is just text, what makes it “special”?
