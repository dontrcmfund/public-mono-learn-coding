# Python learning roadmap (teacher plan)

Goal: move from basics to practical capability with low cognitive load.

Phase 1: Core language
- Complete Python basics 1-20
- Focus on values, control flow, functions, and data structures

Phase 2: Small projects
- Complete small projects 1-20
- Practice typed/structured thinking, validation, and state updates

Phase 3: API scripting
- Learn HTTP requests, JSON parsing, retries, and reporting
- Build scripts that connect external data to useful outputs

Phase 4: Scale patterns
- Modules, testing, CLI arguments, and project structure
- Prepare for larger real-world scripts and services

Why this order works
- Basics reduce syntax friction
- Projects improve retention
- APIs make learning practical and career-relevant
- Scale patterns prevent messy growth

If all you remember is one thing
- Learn in this order: understand, apply, connect, then scale
