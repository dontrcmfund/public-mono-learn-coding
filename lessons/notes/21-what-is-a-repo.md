# What is a repo? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a repository is.

Why do we care?
- A repo is the container for a project
- It groups files and history in one place
- It makes sharing and collaboration possible

First principles
- A repo is a folder with a Git history
- It can live on your computer and on GitHub
- The contents are the same, just in two places

What to do (slow and simple)
- Look at your local folder `/Users/don-pro/codex`
- Look at the GitHub page for the repo
- Notice they represent the same project

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a repo is a project with history,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is it helpful to keep everything in one container?
- How is a repo different from a normal folder?
