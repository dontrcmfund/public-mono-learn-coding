# Navigation and paths (macOS)

Goal: learn how to move around the filesystem in the terminal.

Why do we care?
- You need to know where you are before you act
- Many commands depend on your current folder
- Paths are how the computer locates things

First principles
- A path is a location, like an address
- The current folder is your “working directory”
- You can use absolute or relative paths

Core commands
- `pwd` shows where you are
- `ls` lists files and folders
- `cd` changes folders

What to do (slow and simple)
- Run `pwd` and read the path
- Run `ls` and see what is inside
- Run `cd ..` to go up one folder

Checkpoint
- If you can say “paths are addresses,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is it helpful to know exactly where you are?
- What feels different from Finder?
