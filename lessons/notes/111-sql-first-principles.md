# SQL first principles

Goal: understand SQL as a language for asking data questions.

Why do we care?
- SQL is the standard way to read and modify relational data
- It is concise, expressive, and widely transferable

First principles
- `SELECT` reads data
- `INSERT` adds data
- `UPDATE` changes data
- `DELETE` removes data
- `WHERE` filters data

Rule of thumb
- Start with read queries before write queries
- Always filter updates/deletes with `WHERE`

If all you remember is one thing
- SQL is how you ask precise questions of structured data
