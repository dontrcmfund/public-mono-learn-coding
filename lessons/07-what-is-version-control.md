# What is version control? (first principles)

Goal: understand why we use version control.

Why do we care?
- It lets us save history and undo mistakes
- It helps people collaborate without overwriting work

First principles
- Version control is a history of changes
- Git is the tool that saves that history
- GitHub is a website that stores a copy online

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the `.git` folder (just look, do not change)
- Remember: Git tracks changes for this repo

Checkpoint
- If you can say “git saves a history of changes,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is history useful when learning?
- How would you feel without an undo button?
