# Python design and indentation (why it is this way)

Goal: understand why Python uses indentation as syntax and why that helps learning.

Why do we care?
- Indentation rules force readable structure
- Consistent layout reduces hidden logic bugs
- Teams can read each other's code faster

Short history
- Python emphasized readability from the beginning (1991)
- The community adopted style guidance early (PEP 8)
- Indentation-as-syntax removed style debates that hurt collaboration

First principles
- Code structure should be visible to humans
- Indentation shows logical blocks explicitly
- Clear structure improves memory and debugging

Etymology and context
- PEP means Python Enhancement Proposal
- PEP 8 is the style guide used across Python projects

If all you remember is one thing
- In Python, readable structure is not optional; it is part of the language
