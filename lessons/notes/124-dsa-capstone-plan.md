# DSA capstone plan

Goal: integrate core algorithm patterns into one practical toolkit.

Capstone idea
- Build a CLI with reusable algorithm commands
- Include searching, interval merging, and string/window checks
- Add deterministic tests for each command behavior

Why this matters
- You move from solving one problem to organizing many solutions
- You practice architecture and algorithm selection together

Capstone structure
- `core` functions: pure algorithm implementations
- `cli` layer: argument parsing and output formatting
- `tests`: contract checks and edge cases

If all you remember is one thing
- Real algorithm skill is selecting and packaging patterns clearly
