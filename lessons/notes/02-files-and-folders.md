# Files and folders (first principles)

Goal: understand what a file is and why folders matter.

Why do we care?
- Code is just text stored in files
- Folders keep related files together
- Clear structure makes learning (and debugging) easier

First principles
- A file is a named container for text
- A folder is a container for files (and other folders)
- The path tells you where something lives

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the repo root and look at the list of items
- Say out loud what each folder is for:
  - `apps/` is for future apps
  - `packages/` is for shared code
  - `lessons/` is for learning notes
  - `docs/` is for project docs

Checkpoint
- If you can explain the purpose of each folder, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Which folder would you open first if you wanted to learn?
- Which folder would you open first if you wanted to build?
