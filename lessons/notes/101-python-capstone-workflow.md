# Python capstone workflow

Goal: complete one realistic mini-tool from input to tested output.

Capstone project
- Build a service health reporting tool
- Read service records from JSON
- Validate records
- Compute summary metrics
- Export text and CSV reports

Why this matters
- This mirrors real automation work
- You practice architecture, reliability, and output quality together

Workflow
- Step 1: parse and validate input
- Step 2: transform and summarize data
- Step 3: export outputs
- Step 4: test core logic and edge cases

If all you remember is one thing
- A real tool is a pipeline: validate, transform, report, test
