# What is a README? (first principles)

Goal: understand why projects have a README.

Why do we care?
- It explains the project in plain language
- It tells you how to get started
- It keeps future you from being confused

First principles
- A README is just a text file
- It is usually written in Markdown (`.md`)
- It sits at the repo root so people see it first

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open `README.md`
- Read the “Structure” section
- Notice the backticks around folder names

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a README is the front door,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What would you add to the README later?
- What would confuse you if it was missing?
