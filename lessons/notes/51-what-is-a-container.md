# What is a container? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a container is without deep tech details.

Why do we care?
- Containers make software predictable
- They isolate programs so they do not interfere
- You can delete a container without hurting your computer

Why this matters to you (real life)
- You can try something new without fear
- You can run two apps that need different versions
- You can clean up by removing the container

First principles
- A container is a small, isolated box for a program
- It has its own files and settings
- It shares the computer’s hardware safely

Simple analogy
- Think of a lunchbox: same food, same container, anywhere

If all you remember is one thing
- A container is a safe, isolated box for a program

What to do (slow and simple)
- Say out loud: “A container is a small box for a program”

Checkpoint
- If you can explain the lunchbox analogy, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is isolation helpful when learning?
- How does the lunchbox analogy fit your life?
