# Extensions (first principles)

Goal: understand what extensions are and why to be careful with them.

Why do we care?
- Extensions add features to VS Code
- Too many extensions can be confusing
- You can add them later when you need them

First principles
- An extension is a small add‑on tool
- It changes or improves the editor
- You choose what to install

What to do (slow and simple)
- Click the Extensions icon on the left
- Notice there are thousands
- Do not install anything yet

Checkpoint
- If you can say “extensions are optional add‑ons,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might adding too many tools feel overwhelming?
- What would make you decide to install one?
