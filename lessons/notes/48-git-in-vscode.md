# Git in VS Code (first principles)

Goal: understand how VS Code shows Git changes.

Why do we care?
- You can see what changed without leaving the editor
- It makes version control less scary

First principles
- Git tracks changes to files
- VS Code shows those changes visually
- You can stage and commit from the Source Control panel

What to do (slow and simple)
- Click the Source Control icon on the left
- Notice it shows changed files (if any)
- Do not commit yet — just look

Checkpoint
- If you can say “VS Code can show Git changes,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Would a visual list of changes make Git easier?
- What would you want to see before committing?
