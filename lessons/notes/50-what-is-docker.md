# What is Docker? (first principles)

Goal: understand what Docker is in plain language.

Why do we care?
- It helps software run the same way on any computer
- It reduces “works on my machine” problems
- It saves you time when following tutorials

Why this matters to you (real life)
- You will copy a tutorial and it will “just work”
- You can avoid long setup steps that fail
- You can remove a container without breaking your computer

First principles
- Docker runs programs inside containers
- A container is an isolated mini‑environment
- The container includes what the program needs

If all you remember is one thing
- Docker is a way to run software in a clean, repeatable box

Gentle reminder
- Docker can feel abstract at first
- You are not behind — this is new for almost everyone

What to do (slow and simple)
- Just read this lesson
- No commands yet

Checkpoint
- If you can say “Docker runs programs in containers so they work the same,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- When have you tried a tutorial and it broke?
- How would it feel if setup was always the same?
