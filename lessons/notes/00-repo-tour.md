# Repo tour

Goal: understand the folders, why they exist, and how this structure helps you learn with less stress.

Why do we care?
- A clear structure lowers confusion for new learners
- You find files faster and make fewer mistakes
- You build the habit of organizing work before writing code

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if you felt lost in other projects, structure solves that pain
- Present: this helps you know exactly where to read and where to practice
- Future: teams expect clear project structure; this is a professional habit

First principles
- A project is just files and folders with meaning
- Folder names are signals to humans
- Good structure is a memory tool, not just a technical choice

Short history (why this practice exists)
- Early software projects were often ad-hoc and hard to navigate
- As teams grew, predictable folder conventions became necessary
- Modern tooling (lint/test/build) works best with clear structure

Etymology
- `repo` is short for repository, meaning a storage place
- `monorepo` means one repository containing multiple related packages/apps

What to do
- Open the repo tree and note each top-level folder
- Read `README.md`
- Check `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and see how workspaces are defined

If all you remember is one thing
- Structure is not extra work; structure is what makes learning and building sustainable

Checkpoint
- If you can explain the purpose of each top-level folder in one sentence, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What folder would you open first to learn?
- What folder would you open first to build?
