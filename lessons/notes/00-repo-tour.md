# Repo tour

Goal: understand the folders and why they exist.

What to do
- Open the repo tree and note each top-level folder
- Read `README.md`
- Check `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and see how workspaces are defined

Why this matters
- Monorepos get their power from structure
- The workspaces file is the “index” that makes tooling treat the repo as one project

Reflection
- What folders do you expect to add first?
- What tool do you think you will need soon?
