# DSA problem-solving workflow

Goal: turn algorithm questions into a repeatable process.

Why do we care?
- Panic comes from uncertainty, not difficulty alone
- A stable workflow reduces cognitive overload

Workflow
- Clarify input, output, and constraints
- Solve with a simple correct baseline
- Identify bottleneck and improve structure/algorithm
- Validate with edge cases
- State time and space complexity

Teacher prompt checklist
- What assumptions are you making?
- What happens on empty input?
- Can this be solved in one pass?
- Is sorting allowed or too expensive?

If all you remember is one thing
- Solve correctly first, then optimize intentionally
