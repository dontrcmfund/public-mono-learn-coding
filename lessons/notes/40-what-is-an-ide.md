# What is an IDE? (first principles)

Goal: understand what an IDE is and why VS Code helps beginners.

Why do we care?
- An IDE is a place to write, run, and understand code
- It gathers tools in one window so you feel less lost
- It gives helpful feedback when you make mistakes

First principles
- An IDE is just a program for working with code
- VS Code is a popular, free IDE
- It shows your files, your code, and tools to run it

Gentle reminder
- Feeling confused at first is normal
- You are not “bad at this” — it is just new
- We will go slow, one tiny step at a time

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open VS Code
- Notice: it is just a window with panels
- You do not need to change anything yet

Checkpoint
- If you can say “an IDE is a workspace for code,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What part of VS Code feels most confusing?
- What would make it feel less scary?
