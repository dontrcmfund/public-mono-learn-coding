# public-mono-learn-coding

Learning-focused monorepo scaffold. No functional apps yet. This repo is meant to grow as lessons accumulate.

## Structure
- `apps/` placeholder for future apps
- `packages/` shared libraries and utilities
- `lessons/` markdown-based learning notes
- `docs/` repo-level documentation

## Getting started (later)
We will add dependencies and tooling as lessons require them. For now this is just the scaffold.

## Suggested next lesson
Start with `lessons/00-repo-tour.md`.
