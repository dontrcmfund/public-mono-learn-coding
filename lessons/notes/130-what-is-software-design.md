# What is software design? (first principles)

Goal: understand software design as decision-making, not decoration.

Why do we care?
- Good design keeps code readable and changeable
- Poor design increases bugs and slows every future feature
- Teams rely on shared design patterns to collaborate safely

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if old code felt hard to change, design quality was likely the reason
- Present: design helps you avoid tangled logic in small projects
- Future: design decisions compound as projects scale

First principles
- Design is how responsibilities are divided
- Modules should have clear roles and boundaries
- Data flow should be explicit and testable

Short history
- Early programs were often monolithic and hard to maintain
- As systems grew, architecture patterns emerged to reduce coupling
- Modern engineering emphasizes separation of concerns and testability

If all you remember is one thing
- Software design is organizing code so change stays safe and affordable
