# Formatting and linting (first principles)

Goal: understand the difference between formatting and linting.

Why do we care?
- Formatting makes code easy to read
- Linting finds common mistakes early
- Both reduce confusion

First principles
- Formatting changes how code looks, not what it does
- Linting checks rules and potential problems
- Tools can do both for you

What to do (slow and simple)
- Notice we do not have these tools yet
- That is okay — we will add them when needed

Checkpoint
- If you can say “formatting is style, linting is rules,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- How could messy code slow you down?
- Why is it helpful to have consistent style?
