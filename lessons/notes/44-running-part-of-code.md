# Running part of code (first principles)

Goal: learn how to test small pieces instead of everything.

Why do we care?
- Small tests reduce fear and confusion
- You can isolate problems faster

First principles
- You do not need to run the whole project
- You can run a single file or small experiment
- This is how you troubleshoot calmly

Common ways
- Use a small “scratch” file for experiments
- Run a single file from the terminal
- Use the editor’s Run button (if available)

What to do (slow and simple)
- Create a file called `scratch.txt` in the repo
- Write a note inside it
- Notice that small files are safe places to explore

Checkpoint
- If you can say “I can test small pieces,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What would you like to test in a tiny file?
- How could this reduce stress?
