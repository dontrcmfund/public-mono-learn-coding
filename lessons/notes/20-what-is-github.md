# What is GitHub? (first principles)

Goal: understand what GitHub is, why it exists, and why developers rely on it.

Why do we care?
- It stores your repository online
- It makes collaboration and review practical
- It gives backup, history, and visibility in one place

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if you lost files before, remote history protects you
- Present: you can track your learning progress publicly or privately
- Future: GitHub workflows are standard in many engineering jobs

First principles
- Git tracks changes locally
- GitHub hosts Git repositories remotely
- Commits, branches, and pull requests are collaboration building blocks

Short history (why this exists)
- Git was created in 2005 to manage Linux kernel development at scale
- GitHub launched in 2008 to make Git easier to share and collaborate with
- The platform popularized pull requests, issues, and social coding

Etymology
- `Git` is just the tool name chosen by its creator
- `hub` means a central place where activity connects
- `GitHub` literally means a central place for Git projects

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open your repo on GitHub
- Find the `README.md` on the page
- Notice you can read files without downloading

If all you remember is one thing
- GitHub is the collaboration layer on top of Git history

Checkpoint
- If you can explain the difference between Git (tool) and GitHub (host), you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is online history useful when learning?
- How could pull requests help you improve faster?
