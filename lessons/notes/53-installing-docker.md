# Installing Docker (macOS)

Goal: understand how Docker is installed and why it needs permission.

Why do we care?
- Docker uses system features that need setup
- Installing it correctly prevents confusion later
- A clean install makes tutorials easier

Why this matters to you (real life)
- You will avoid mysterious errors during lessons
- You will be able to follow most Docker guides without extra steps

First principles
- Docker Desktop is the app for macOS
- It installs both a UI and a command‑line tool
- It may ask for permissions to run containers

What to do (slow and simple)
- Download Docker Desktop from the official site
- Drag it into Applications
- Open it and follow prompts

If all you remember is one thing
- Docker Desktop is the easiest way to install Docker on a Mac

Checkpoint
- If Docker Desktop opens without errors, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might Docker need extra permissions?
- How does a proper install reduce future issues?
