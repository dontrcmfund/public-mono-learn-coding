# What is a Docker image? (first principles)

Goal: understand what an image is and why it matters.

Why do we care?
- Images are the recipe for containers
- You can share images so others run the same app
- Images make setup repeatable

Why this matters to you (real life)
- You can download the same environment your teacher uses
- You can avoid “it works for you but not for me”
- You can rebuild the same container later

First principles
- An image is a blueprint
- A container is a running copy of that blueprint
- Many containers can come from one image

Simple analogy
- Image = recipe, container = cooked meal

If all you remember is one thing
- Images are blueprints; containers are the running copies

What to do (slow and simple)
- Say out loud: “Image is the blueprint; container is the running copy”

Checkpoint
- If you can explain the recipe analogy, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is a reusable blueprint helpful?
- When have you needed “the exact same setup” as someone else?
