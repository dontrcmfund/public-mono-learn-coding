# Python small projects principles

Goal: build practical Python skill through tiny, complete workflows.

Why do we care?
- Small projects connect syntax to real outcomes
- Complete loops (input -> logic -> output) improve retention
- Projects reveal best practices faster than isolated snippets

Project best practices
- Validate input early
- Keep functions focused on one responsibility
- Return values instead of printing everywhere
- Separate data transformation from user interaction

Past, present, future anchor
- Past: connect each project to a real task you did manually
- Present: automate one small personal task
- Future: combine these blocks into larger automation tools

If all you remember is one thing
- Small complete projects are the fastest bridge from learning to real utility
