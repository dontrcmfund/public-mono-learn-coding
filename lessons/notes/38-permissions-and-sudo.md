# Permissions and sudo (macOS)

Goal: understand permission errors and what `sudo` means.

Why do we care?
- Some files are protected for safety
- Permission errors are common for beginners
- `sudo` gives extra power and can be risky

First principles
- Files have owners and permissions
- You might not have permission to change everything
- `sudo` means “run as a super user”

Safe habit
- Use `sudo` only when you understand why
- If unsure, stop and ask

What to do (slow and simple)
- Notice a permission error if one appears
- Read the error message — it usually says “permission denied”

Checkpoint
- If you can say “permissions protect files,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why would the system block some actions?
- How could `sudo` be dangerous if used carelessly?
