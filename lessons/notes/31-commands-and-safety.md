# Commands and safety (macOS)

Goal: understand what a command is and how to stay safe.

Why do we care?
- Commands can change or delete files
- Reading a command first prevents mistakes
- Safe habits make learning less stressful

First principles
- A command is a line of text you ask the computer to run
- The computer does exactly what you say
- You can always pause and read before pressing Enter

Safety habits
- Read the full command before running it
- Avoid `sudo` until you understand it
- Ask “What will this change?”

What to do (slow and simple)
- Read this command: `ls`
- Say out loud what you think it does: “list files”
- Notice it does not change anything

Checkpoint
- If you can say “I will read commands first,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why does the terminal feel risky?
- How does slowing down reduce mistakes?
