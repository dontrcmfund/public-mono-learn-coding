# How to study this curriculum (for slow, deep learning)

Goal: turn lessons into long-term memory instead of short-term copying.

Why do we care?
- Speed feels productive but often loses retention
- Deep understanding comes from repetition with small variation

Study method (per lesson block)
- Read one lesson block fully
- Say the "why" out loud in your own words
- Run the code
- Change one line and predict the output before running
- Write one sentence: "what changed and why"

Memory anchors (past, present, future)
- Past: connect the lesson to a frustration you already had
- Present: identify one thing this lesson helps you do today
- Future: identify one real project where this pattern appears

Best practices for confidence
- Learn in small loops (read, run, change, explain)
- Keep confusion visible by writing short questions in notes
- Revisit difficult lessons after 24 hours and after 7 days

If all you remember is one thing
- Understanding grows when you predict, test, and explain, not when you only read
