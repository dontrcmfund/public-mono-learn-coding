# Running code (first principles)

Goal: understand what it means to “run” code in VS Code.

Why do we care?
- Running code is how you see results
- It turns text into action

First principles
- “Run” means “execute the instructions in a file”
- Most code runs in the terminal
- VS Code gives you a terminal inside the app

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the Terminal panel (View -> Terminal)
- Notice the blinking cursor in the terminal
- For now, do not run anything — just notice where you would type

Checkpoint
- If you can say “running code means executing instructions,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- What feels unclear about running code?
- Would a tiny example make you feel safer?
