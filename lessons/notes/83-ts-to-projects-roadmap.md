# TypeScript to projects roadmap

Goal: bridge from syntax lessons to real project work without overload.

Phase 1: TypeScript bridge
- Complete `24-ts-bridge-1-10.ts`
- Complete `25-ts-bridge-11-20.ts`
- Focus on understanding type errors as feedback

Phase 2: Small projects
- Start with one-file projects using DOM and TypeScript
- Add one feature at a time (state, validation, persistence)
- Keep project scope intentionally small

Phase 3: Browser APIs
- Add `localStorage`, `fetch`, and URL handling to projects
- Introduce asynchronous UI states (loading, success, error)

Why this order works
- Type safety first reduces confusion in project code
- Projects create memory through repeated application
- APIs make projects realistic once fundamentals are stable

If all you remember is one thing
- Learn types first, then build small, then add real-world APIs
