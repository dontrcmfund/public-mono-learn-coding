# What is a branch? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a branch is and why it exists.

Why do we care?
- A branch lets you try ideas without breaking main work
- It keeps experiments separate
- It makes collaboration safer

First principles
- A branch is a named line of history
- The default branch is usually called `main`
- You can make a new branch to work on changes

What to do (slow and simple)
- On GitHub, look for the branch dropdown
- Notice the default branch name
- Know you can create another one later

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a branch is a separate line of history,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why would you want to keep experiments separate?
- How does a branch reduce fear of mistakes?
