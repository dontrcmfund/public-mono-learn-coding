# What is JavaScript? (first principles + history)

Goal: understand what JavaScript is, why it exists, and why it feels the way it does.

Why do we care?
- JavaScript is the main language of the web
- It runs in every browser, so it is widely useful
- Understanding its history helps you forgive its quirks

Why this matters to you (past, present, future)
- Past: if web code felt mysterious, JS explains how pages become interactive
- Present: you can now read and run scripts in both browser and Node lessons
- Future: JS foundations transfer to frameworks, tooling, and backend work

Short history (the “why” behind the design)
- 1995: the web was mostly static pages (text and images)
- Browsers needed a way to make pages interactive (clicks, forms, animations)
- JavaScript was created quickly (in about 10 days) to solve this urgent need
- It had to fit inside the browser and be easy for beginners to pick up
- It borrowed ideas from other languages but kept a simple, flexible style

How the history shaped the language
- Speed of creation led to some inconsistent parts
- It favors flexibility over strict rules
- It allows many ways to do the same thing
- It evolved over time without breaking old websites

First principles
- JavaScript is just instructions written as text
- A computer reads those instructions and follows them
- The browser is the original “home” of JavaScript

Etymology (name origin)
- The name “JavaScript” was chosen for marketing
- It is not the same as Java (different languages)
- This naming confusion still affects beginners today

If all you remember is one thing
- JavaScript is the web’s language, built fast to make pages interactive

What to do (slow and simple)
- Read this lesson once, then pause
- Say out loud: “JavaScript runs in the browser”

Checkpoint
- If you can say “JavaScript was built for the web, fast and flexible,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- How does the quick history explain why JS feels flexible?
- How might backwards compatibility affect design?
