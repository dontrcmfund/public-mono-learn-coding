# What is a folder naming convention? (first principles)

Goal: understand why we name folders consistently.

Why do we care?
- Consistent names make projects easier to navigate
- It reduces guessing and confusion
- It helps new people learn faster

First principles
- A convention is a shared agreement
- It is not required by the computer
- It is required by people to stay organized

What to do (slow and simple)
- Look at the top-level folders: `apps`, `packages`, `lessons`, `docs`
- Notice the names are short and clear
- Say out loud what each name suggests

Checkpoint
- If you can say “conventions are agreements for clarity,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- How would a random folder name make you feel?
- What name would you choose for a folder of exercises?
