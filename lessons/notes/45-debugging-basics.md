# Debugging basics (first principles)

Goal: understand what debugging is and why it helps.

Why do we care?
- Debugging helps you find the cause, not just the symptom
- It removes guesswork
- It builds confidence

First principles
- A bug is a mismatch between expectation and reality
- Debugging is a calm process of checking what the code is doing
- Tools can pause code so you can inspect it

Key ideas
- Breakpoints pause code on a line
- Step over moves line by line
- Watch/variables show what values are right now

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open the Run and Debug panel (left sidebar)
- Notice it has options but you do not need them yet

Checkpoint
- If you can say “debugging is checking what code is doing,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why does guessing feel stressful?
- How would pausing code make things clearer?
