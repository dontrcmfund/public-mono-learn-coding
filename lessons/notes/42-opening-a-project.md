# Opening a project (first principles)

Goal: understand how to open a folder as a project.

Why do we care?
- VS Code needs to know which folder is “the project”
- Opening the right folder makes tools work properly

First principles
- A project is just a folder of files
- VS Code works best when you open the folder, not a single file

What to do (slow and simple)
- In VS Code, choose File -> Open Folder
- Select your repo folder (for us: `/Users/don-pro/codex`)
- Click “Open” and allow the trust prompt if it appears

Checkpoint
- If you can see the repo files in Explorer, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might opening a single file feel limiting?
- How does “Open Folder” help you see the whole project?
