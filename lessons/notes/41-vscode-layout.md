# VS Code layout (first principles)

Goal: learn the main parts of the VS Code window.

Why do we care?
- Knowing where things are reduces anxiety
- You can always return to a “home base”

First principles
- VS Code is just panels that show different information
- You can ignore most of them at first

Main areas
- Explorer (left): your files and folders
- Editor (center): where you read and write
- Terminal (bottom): where you run commands
- Status bar (bottom strip): shows helpful info

What to do (slow and simple)
- Click the Explorer icon on the left
- Open `README.md`
- Notice it opens in the center editor

Checkpoint
- If you can point to Explorer, Editor, and Terminal, you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Which panel feels most useful so far?
- Which panel feels confusing, and why?
