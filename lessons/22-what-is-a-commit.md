# What is a commit? (first principles)

Goal: understand what a commit is and why it matters.

Why do we care?
- A commit saves a snapshot of your work
- It creates a point you can return to
- It explains what changed and why

First principles
- A commit is a saved “state” of the repo
- It has a message that describes the change
- Many commits make a history

What to do (slow and simple)
- Open GitHub and click the “commits” link
- Notice each commit has a short message
- Notice each commit has a time

Checkpoint
- If you can say “a commit is a saved snapshot,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why is saving progress useful when learning?
- What would make a good commit message?
