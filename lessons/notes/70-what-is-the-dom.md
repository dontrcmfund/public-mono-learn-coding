# What is the DOM? (first principles)

Goal: understand what the DOM is and why it matters.

Why do we care?
- The DOM is how JavaScript talks to a web page
- It is how you change text, buttons, and layout

First principles
- A web page is made of HTML
- The browser turns HTML into a live “tree” of elements
- That tree is called the DOM (Document Object Model)

Why this matters to you (real life)
- If you want a button to do something, you need the DOM
- If you want to update text on screen, you need the DOM

If all you remember is one thing
- The DOM is the browser’s live version of your HTML
