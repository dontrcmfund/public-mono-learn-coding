# What is push and pull? (first principles)

Goal: understand how your computer and GitHub stay in sync.

Why do we care?
- You want your online repo to match your local repo
- You want to back up your work
- You want to keep up with changes from others

First principles
- Push sends your local commits to GitHub
- Pull brings remote commits down to your computer
- Sync means both sides are the same

What to do (slow and simple)
- Imagine a “two-way mailbox” between your laptop and GitHub
- Push is sending mail out
- Pull is receiving mail in

Checkpoint
- If you can say “push sends, pull receives,” you are ready to move on

Reflection
- Why might you push after a lesson?
- Why might you pull before you start working?
